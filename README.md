📌 Overview

This project is a Machine Learning–powered Loan Classification System that predicts whether a customer's loan application should be Approved or Rejected based on key financial and demographic factors.

The project includes:

✔️ Data preprocessing
✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔️ Model training & evaluation
✔️ Feature scaling
✔️ A fully deployed Streamlit Web App
✔️ Interactive dashboard for insights

🎯 Project Objectives

Build an accurate Machine Learning model for loan approval prediction.

Analyze loan approval trends using interactive charts.

Deploy the model online with a user-friendly interface.

📊 Dashboard Features

To give deep insights, the web app includes:

📌 1. Loan Approval Rate

Visualizes approval vs rejection distribution.
(Your dataset has ~22% approval, ~78% rejection → indicating class imbalance.)

📌 2. Applicant Income Distribution

Shows income patterns between approved and rejected customers.

📌 3. Credit Score Distribution

Identifies how credit scores affect loan approval.

📌 4. Loan Amount Trends

Compares loan amount requested vs approved.

These insights help demonstrate your business understanding and data storytelling skills.

🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model pipeline includes:

Algorithms Used

✔️ Logistic Regression
✔️ Random Forest
✔️ Support Vector Classifier (optional)

(Random Forest performed best in your project — update if needed.)

Preprocessing Steps

Missing value treatment

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling (scaler.pkl)

Train-test split

Handling class imbalance (SMOTE, if used)
